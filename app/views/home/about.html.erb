	<h3>We're on a mission </h3></br></br>

	<h3> The #1 reason people quit tennis is because they donâ€™t have someone to play with. Our goal	 is to grow tennis by making it easier to get practice, matches, and lessons on your local courts. </h3></br></br>
	<h3> Join our community to meet evenly-matched local players. Always have someone to practice with and compete in our fun and flexible Bracket Challenge League for regular matchplay. </h3></br></br>
		
	<h3> Please sign up and have access to the Tennis Mate world! </h3></br></br>
